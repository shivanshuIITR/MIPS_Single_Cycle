MIPS Single Cycle Processor
=====================
Implementation of MIPS Single Cycle Processor using VHDL

## Introdution
MIPS Single Cycle Processor is most basic version of Processor.

Important Specifications of this implementation of Processor
- 65536x32 bit Instruction Register
- 32x16 bit RegisterFiles
- 65536x16 bit Data Memory
- 16 bit Address and Data length
- 32 bit Instruction Length
- Basic Instructions includes:
  - ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT, ADDI
  - LW, SW
  - BEQ, JUMP
  - PRREG, PRMEM
  - See `Documentation\Documentation.pdf` for more information.

Some of main features of this code:
- All basic components are made using Behavioral Architecture and Merged using Structural Architecture in `TOP_MODULE.vhd`
- A Documentation will be provided soon for available Instructions and their formats, available registers and Memory etc. Currently, `Demo1.fdo` in `Scripts/` is included as an example. Comment part contains a program which can be written using Python Program. Python Program will automatically generate the Modelsim script file.
- A Python Program to make script which will initialize IR in ModelSim. It will take a simple instructions as Input. This output script can be run in ModelSim to get Simulation of Processor.

## Dependencies:
- ModelSim (Code is sucessfully tested on Student Edition)
- Python 2.7 (Just to convert Mnemonics of Instructions to Hexadecimal Instruction which will be used in ModelSim)
- Xilinx WebPack Design Software(Optional)

## Usage
- Clone this Repository on your local machine (Or download ZIP file and extract it's content)
- `src/` folder contains Source files of the Code. Open `MIPS_Single_Cycle.ise` using Xilinx. All VHDL Files are available here.
- Open ModelSim and change current directory to `Scripts/`.
- Run `do <filename>.fdo` to add Intructions in IR.
- `<filename>.fdo` can be made using Python Programs available in base folder.
